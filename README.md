# Neuronal-activity-MRI
 Is it possible to characterize neuronal activity using magnetic resonance?
 
The brain is an inherently complex organ with intricate structure and behaviour. A part of this complexity is accounted to its ability to function at several different scales, both in the temporal and spatial domains. Currently, we have two non-invasive techniques; MRI and EEG, to map the neuronal activity in the brain. The inexplicable intrinsic dynamics exhibited by the neurons at multiple timescales is only a little understood and hence there is a growing need to study the dynamics of the neuronal activity. In this project, we investigate the plausibility of characterising these neuronal activities into regular and chaotic regimes by the magnetic resonance of spins in the neuron cell walls.

- Goal of the Program
The goal of this project is to develop a simulation for the dynamics of a spin ensemble (spins in a neuron cell wall), submitted to three interactions: magnetic resonance from the MRI, electromagnetic noises issued from neuronal activity and with the biological medium acting as a thermostat.
